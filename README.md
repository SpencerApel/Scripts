# Scripts
##### Thanks to [LukeSmithxyz](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) for some of the scripts
##### Thanks to a random article for the Arch Linux ARM wifi script (would give credits, but cannot find website)

#### Scripts:
- aur-update (Perform git pull in each aur package directory, recursively)
- displayselect (Choose multi-monitor setup, or one display)
- dmenupass (Used for 'sudo -A' or ASKPASS variable)
- prompt (Used in many sxhkd bindings)
- more coming...
